# ZBD Template

## What is it?

ZBD Template is an easy to use Unity Package for Android Mobile Games, however many features of the code base can be used in other platforms.

It comes with an out of the box prefab you can drag and drop into your game which adds a bitcoin reward functionaility with minimal set up.

Out of the box it allows a user to earn bitcoin based on how long they have played the game i.e. 10 sats every 10 minutes

However it is full customizable allowing the developer to change and add code to suit their specific usecase

## How does it work?

ZBD Template leveages a few different services

1. The [Beamable](https://beamable.com/) SDK for Unity to handle backend microservices
2. Google [Play Integrity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqUTX6hR9Mk&t=66s) and app and device verification
3. [Quago](https://www.quago.io/) Anticheat for bot protection
4. [ZBD API](https://zbd.dev/docs/introduction) called via Beamable microservice
